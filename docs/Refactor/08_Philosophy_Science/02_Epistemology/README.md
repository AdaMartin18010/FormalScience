# Epistemology

## 📋 Overview

Epistemology is the branch of philosophy concerned with the theory of knowledge. It investigates the nature, origin, scope, and limits of human knowledge, addressing questions such as "What is knowledge?", "How is knowledge acquired?", and "What do people know?".

This directory contains the formal science approach to epistemology, establishing rigorous frameworks for understanding knowledge, belief, justification, and truth.

## 🎯 Core Objectives

1. **Knowledge Formalization**: Develop formal models of knowledge representation and acquisition
2. **Belief System Analysis**: Establish logical frameworks for belief formation and justification
3. **Truth Theory Development**: Formalize different theories of truth and their implications
4. **Justification Frameworks**: Create mathematical models for epistemic justification

## 📚 Directory Structure

The epistemology section is organized into the following components:

1. **[Knowledge Theory](./01_Knowledge/)**: Core concepts of knowledge, including definitions, types, and formal models.
   - `01_Knowledge_Theory.md`: Formal knowledge theory and epistemological foundations.
   - `01.2.1_知识理论.md`: Chinese version of knowledge theory.

2. **[Belief Theory](./02_Belief/)**: Analysis of belief systems, including doxastic logic and belief dynamics.
   - `02_Belief_Theory.md`: Formal models of belief systems.
   - `01.2.2_信念理论.md`: Chinese version of belief theory.

3. **[Justification Theory](./03_Justification/)**: Theories of epistemic justification and evidence.
   - `03_Justification_Theory.md`: Formal justification frameworks.
   - `01.2.3_确证理论.md`: Chinese version of justification theory.

4. **[Truth Theory](./04_Truth/)**: Analysis of truth theories from correspondence to deflationary approaches.
   - `04_Truth_Theory.md`: Formal models of truth concepts.
   - `01.2.4_真理理论.md`: Chinese version of truth theory.

## 🔄 Integration with Other Domains

Epistemology serves as the foundation for:

- **Logic**: Providing semantic foundations for logical systems
- **Formal Methods**: Establishing correctness criteria for verification
- **AI & ML**: Informing knowledge representation and reasoning systems
- **Scientific Methodology**: Providing philosophical foundations for scientific knowledge
