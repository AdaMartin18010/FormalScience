## 1. Basic Concepts

### 1.1 Cognitive Science Fundamentals

**Definition 1.1.1** (Cognitive Process)
Cognitive processes are information processing activities of the human mind, including:

- Perception: Receiving and processing sensory information
- Attention: Selective information processing
- Memory: Information storage and retrieval
- Reasoning: Logical and conceptual reasoning
- Decision-making: Information-based choices

**Definition 1.1.2** (Cognitive Architecture)
Cognitive architecture is a theoretical framework describing the structure of human cognitive systems, including:

- Working memory system
- Long-term memory system
- Attention control system
- Executive control system

**Definition 1.1.3** (Cognitive Language)
Cognitive language is a formal language used to describe cognitive processes, including:

- Cognitive state description language
- Cognitive operation language
- Cognitive reasoning language
- Cognitive learning language

### 1.2 Basic Characteristics of Cognitive Languages

**Definition 1.2.1** (Cognitive Grammar)
Cognitive grammar $G_C = (V_C, \Sigma_C, R_C, S_C)$ where:

- $V_C$ is the set of cognitive non-terminal symbols
- $\Sigma_C$ is the set of cognitive terminal symbols
- $R_C$ is the set of cognitive rewriting rules
- $S_C$ is the cognitive start symbol

**Definition 1.2.2** (Cognitive Semantics)
Cognitive semantics maps cognitive expressions to cognitive processes:

- Perceptual semantics: Processing of sensory information
- Memory semantics: Information storage and retrieval
- Reasoning semantics: Logical reasoning processes
- Decision semantics: Choices and behaviors

**Definition 1.2.3** (Cognitive Computation Models)
Cognitive computation models include:

- ACT-R cognitive architecture
- SOAR cognitive architecture
- Working memory models
- Attention models

## 2. Formal Definitions

### 2.1 Cognitive Grammar

**Definition 2.1.1** (Cognitive State Grammar)
Cognitive state grammar defines the states of cognitive systems:

```text
CognitiveState ::= WorkingMemory LongTermMemory Attention
WorkingMemory ::= Chunk+
Chunk ::= Type Slot*
Slot ::= Name Value
LongTermMemory ::= DeclarativeMemory ProceduralMemory
DeclarativeMemory ::= Fact+
ProceduralMemory ::= Production+
```

**Definition 2.1.2** (Cognitive Operation Grammar)
Cognitive operation grammar defines cognitive operations:

```text
CognitiveOperation ::= Perceive | Attend | Retrieve | Encode | Decode
Perceive ::= Sense(Stimulus) -> Percept
Attend ::= Select(Stimulus) -> FocusedStimulus
Retrieve ::= Search(Memory, Cue) -> RetrievedItem
Encode ::= Process(Stimulus) -> MemoryTrace
Decode ::= Interpret(MemoryTrace) -> Meaning
```

**Definition 2.1.3** (Cognitive Reasoning Grammar)
Cognitive reasoning grammar defines reasoning processes:

```text
Reasoning ::= Deduction | Induction | Abduction
Deduction ::= Premise* -> Conclusion
Induction ::= Observation* -> Generalization
Abduction ::= Observation Hypothesis -> BestExplanation
```

### 2.2 Cognitive Semantics

**Definition 2.2.1** (Perceptual Semantics)
Perceptual semantics $\llbracket \cdot \rrbracket_P$ is defined as:
$$\llbracket Perceive(s) \rrbracket_P = Process(s) \circ Encode(s)$$

**Definition 2.2.2** (Memory Semantics)
Memory semantics $\llbracket \cdot \rrbracket_M$ is defined as:
$$\llbracket Store(m) \rrbracket_M = Encode(m) \rightarrow LTM$$
$$\llbracket Retrieve(c) \rrbracket_M = Search(LTM, c) \rightarrow WTM$$

**Definition 2.2.3** (Reasoning Semantics)
Reasoning semantics $\llbracket \cdot \rrbracket_R$ is defined as:
$$\llbracket Deduce(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n) \rrbracket_R = \frac{p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n}{c}$$

## 3. Theorems and Proofs

### 3.1 Basic Cognitive Process Theorems

**Theorem 3.1.1** (Working Memory Capacity Limitation)
Human working memory capacity is approximately 7Â±2 chunks of information.

**Proof**:
Through experimental psychology research, Miller (1956) found that humans can maintain approximately 7 units of information in short-term memory.
This can be explained through information theory and cognitive load theory:
$$C = \log_2(N)$$
where $C$ is cognitive capacity and $N$ is the number of information units.

**Theorem 3.1.2** (Attention Bottleneck Theorem)
Human attention systems have processing bottlenecks that prevent simultaneous processing of multiple complex tasks.

**Proof**:
Based on cognitive resource theory, attentional resources are limited:
$$R_{total} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} R_i \leq R_{max}$$
When task demands exceed $R_{max}$, performance declines.

### 3.2 Cognitive Learning Theorems

**Theorem 3.2.1** (Learning Curve Theorem)
Learning processes follow a power law distribution:
$$T = a \cdot N^b$$
where $T$ is response time, $N$ is the number of practice trials, and $a, b$ are constants.

**Proof**:
Based on cognitive learning theory, skill acquisition processes can be modeled using a power law function:
$$\frac{dT}{dN} = -b \cdot a \cdot N^{b-1}$$
This indicates that learning speed decreases with practice trials.

**Theorem 3.2.2** (Forgetting Curve Theorem)
Forgetting processes follow exponential decay:
$$R = e^{-t/\tau}$$
where $R$ is memory retention rate, $t$ is time, and $\tau$ is the time constant.

**Proof**:
Based on memory decay theory, the forgetting process can be modeled as:
$$\frac{dR}{dt} = -\frac{R}{\tau}$$
Solving this differential equation yields the exponential decay function.

```rust
use std::collections::HashMap;

/// Cognitive chunk type
#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
struct Chunk {
    chunk_type: String,
    slots: HashMap<String, String>,
    activation: f64,
    creation_time: f64,
}

impl Chunk {
    /// Create new cognitive chunk
    fn new(chunk_type: String) -> Self {
        Chunk {
            chunk_type,
            slots: HashMap::new(),
            activation: 0.0,
            creation_time: 0.0,
        }
    }
    
    /// Set slot value
    fn set_slot(&mut self, name: String, value: String) {
        self.slots.insert(name, value);
    }
    
    /// Get slot value
    fn get_slot(&self, name: &str) -> Option<&String> {
        self.slots.get(name)
    }
    
    /// Calculate activation value
    fn compute_activation(&mut self, current_time: f64, base_level: f64, decay: f64) {
        let time_since_creation = current_time - self.creation_time;
        self.activation = base_level - decay * time_since_creation.ln();
    }
}

/// Working memory
#[derive(Debug)]
struct WorkingMemory {
    chunks: Vec<Chunk>,
    capacity: usize,
}

impl WorkingMemory {
    /// Create working memory
    fn new(capacity: usize) -> Self {
        WorkingMemory {
            chunks: Vec::new(),
            capacity,
        }
    }
    
    /// Add cognitive chunk
    fn add_chunk(&mut self, mut chunk: Chunk) -> bool {
        if self.chunks.len() >= self.capacity {
            return false; // Working memory is full
        }
        
        chunk.creation_time = std::time::SystemTime::now()
            .duration_since(std::time::UNIX_EPOCH)
            .unwrap()
            .as_secs_f64();
        
        self.chunks.push(chunk);
        true
    }

}

/// Condition for production rule
#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
enum Condition {
    Match(String, String, String), // (chunk_type, slot, value)
    NotMatch(String, String, String),
    GreaterThan(String, String, f64),
    LessThan(String, String, f64),

    long_term_memory: Vec<Chunk>,
}

impl ProductionSystem {
    /// Create new production system
    fn new(wm_capacity: usize) -> Self {
        ProductionSystem {
            productions: Vec::new(),
            working_memory: WorkingMemory::new(wm_capacity),
            long_term_memory: Vec::new(),
        }
    }
    
    /// Add production rule
    fn add_production(&mut self, production: Production) {
        self.productions.push(production);
    }
    
    /// Execute cognitive cycle
    fn cognitive_cycle(&mut self) {
        // Match phase
        let matching_productions = self.match_productions();
        
        // Select phase
        if let Some(selected) = self.select_production(matching_productions) {
            // Execute phase
            self.execute_production(&selected);
        }
    }
    
    /// Match productions against working memory
    fn match_productions(&self) -> Vec<&Production> {
        // Implementation details for matching productions
        Vec::new() // Placeholder
    }
    
    /// Select production based on utility
    fn select_production<'a>(&self, candidates: Vec<&'a Production>) -> Option<&'a Production> {
        candidates.into_iter().max_by(|a, b| a.utility.partial_cmp(&b.utility).unwrap())
    }
    
    /// Execute selected production
    fn execute_production(&mut self, production: &Production) {
        // Implementation details for executing production actions
    }
}
```
